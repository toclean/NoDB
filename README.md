# NoDB
---

NoDB is a database without a database.

  - Terminal interface that acts as a extremely light weight database
  - Inspired by keystores in languages like C/C++ before deciding to use python and go a different route

## Todo

  - Create a web api for use with other projects
  - Create unit tests
